- NZISF is a real “forum”. We welcome anybody to share with us interesting news, ideas, projects, etc., related to cyber security, especially in the field of managing processes. If you would like to offer us a presentation on such a topic, contact the NZISF Chair to discuss details.

- If your company would like to host a Thursday seminar at their premises, contact the Chair to discuss the arrangements.
