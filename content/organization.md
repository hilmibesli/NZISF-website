# NZISF Organization

## Forms of NZISF Activities

- **Monthly seminars on practical aspects of information security implementations:**
  - Since 1996, always (except January) at 0800h on the second Thursday of the month.
  - Initially, seminars were held at the Auckland Club House on Shortland St, and from 2009 onwards at the University School of Business.
  - Until the COVID pandemic, seminars included a cooked breakfast.
  - COVID forced us to convert seminars to an online mode.
  - As the threat of the COVID pandemic diminishes, we have introduced a new format for Thursday seminars: from time to time, we will hold them at companies interested in promoting information security issues. Cooked breakfasts will be served at these events.
  - Yearly average registration at seminars varies from 10 to 23.

- **NZISF supports infosec events like OWASP NZ Days.**

- **We offer consultations for NZISF members.**

- **We have around 300 names on our membership list.** The list is updated every quarter of the year.
